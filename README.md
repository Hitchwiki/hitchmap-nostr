A web application that allows users to view and share hitchhiking experiences on an interactive global map, creating a community-driven platform for hitchhikers to rate and comment on pickup locations and rides. It uses the Nostr protocol for decentralized data storage.

Hitchmap nostr is an effort to put hitchhiking spots and related information on nostr and allowing users to link their existing identities (e.g. [trustroots nip5](https://ideas.trustroots.org/2024/08/14/nostr-updates/)).

Spots, rides and recent changes on hitchwiki are fetched by the [nostrhitch bot](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/nostrhitch) and converted into nostr notes.

## Features

- Interactive globe map with clustered hitchhiking spots
- Color-coded ratings (red/orange/green for poor/average/good experiences)
